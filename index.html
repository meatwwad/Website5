    <h1 id="box1">About</h1>
    I've been making art ever since preschool, it's something that I have always been interested in and it is something that has came to me so naturally. First, when I bacame super serious about art, I created work mostly in pencil and copic markers (alcohol based markers). In highschool I enrolled in AP studio art for my junior year and scored a 5 on my portfolio. In my first set of concentrations, I created work that mostly consisted of oil pastels. I also enrolled in AP studio art during my senior year, even though I graduated a semester early. During my final semster of highschool, my concentrations were all done in Adobe Illustrator and photoshop. I wanted to experiment doing more digital artwork since I enjoyed the adobe programs during my graphics class in highschool. I've also done some freelance work for people, such as album covers for some not so well known soundclound rappers, freelance photo editing in photoshop, and commisioned portraits of people.

     These concentrations were based on portraits of my friends using oil pastels in a stylized way. Oil pastels arent usually used for making, or trying to make, realistic portraits. I wanted to challenge myself by using this medium and style.

    When I became more skilled in adobe illustrator and photoshop by learning these programs in my graphics class, it quickly became something that I was interested in. After doing many pieces of art on paper, I was kind of tired of it, digital artwork was my way of learning the adobe programs more and transitioning to a totally different medium. I gained alot of experience in the adobe programs by creating these pieces, and it was so fun working on the computer. These projects defined the type of art that I wanted to work in, and specifically why I wanted to become a graphic designer.

    <h1 id="box4">Freelance Artwork</h1>
    I first got in to freelance work when my friends saw my artwork and wanted me to draw them. I would draw my friends for free during my 2018-2019 Concentrations and I think that's really when people saw my drawings and thought I was good enough to draw them. I also got in to doing photo editing by one of my mom's ex boyfriends. He was a professional cinematographer, he would ask me to edit some of his photos in photoshop. Whether it was removing people in the background from the photo, editing the lighting situation, removing other background objects, retouching peoples faces, etc, etc, this experiencee quickly advanced my skills in photoshop. He also taught me how to take photos using a real camera, not an iphone camera. This was all extremely helpful towaards my skills as an artist. Some soundcloud rappers from my town saw my artwork that I was posting and wanted me to design artwork for them. Currently, I just do portraits of people in oil pastel or copic markers.
